Zillow Group APIs for Real Estate & Mortgage App Development

Property Listings & Property Data APIs

Zillow’s developer platform offers APIs for property listings and details, though access can be restricted. The flagship is the MLS Listings API, which provides active real estate listings via a RESTful interface ￼. This API returns listings normalized to the RESO data standard (including property attributes like price, photos, beds/baths, etc.) and supports searching by MLS queries. However, it is invite-only and requires MLS partner approval, as data access is granted at the discretion of local MLS boards ￼. In practice, a developer must request access and obtain API credentials (with token authentication) through Zillow’s Bridge platform to use the MLS feed.

For broader property information (beyond active listings), Zillow offers a Public Records API. This provides parcel and historical data on properties nationwide – e.g. tax assessments, past sales transactions, lot size, etc., going back ~15 years ￼. It’s a rich dataset for property details and history, useful for augmenting listings or showing off-market properties. Like the MLS API, the public records feed is a RESTful JSON service accessed via Zillow’s Bridge platform with an API key/token ￼. It is primarily intended for commercial/business use and currently requires approval (invite-only) ￼. Zillow notes that casual researchers or academics can instead download similar aggregated data from their research portal under looser terms ￼. In other words, the Public Records API is available to partners for real-time queries, while open public access is limited to static CSV downloads.

Listing Performance data is also available via Zillow’s Performance Reporting API. This service returns metrics on how listings are performing on Zillow Group sites (Zillow, Trulia, etc.) – for example, number of times a listing appeared in search results, page views, and leads (contacts) generated for the agent ￼. Data can be fetched per listing, agent, office, or feed, typically updated daily ￼. This is useful for brokers/agents to track engagement. The Performance API requires one to request access (part of Zillow’s technology partner program) and uses OAuth 1.0 for authentication ￼ ￼. It’s mainly a partner API (with 1000-listing result pagination limits on queries) rather than a consumer-facing feature ￼.

Key Listing/Property APIs:
	•	MLS Listings API: REST API for active home listings (normalized to standard data fields). Access: Partner-only (MLS invite). Data: Listings (photos, details, status) across supported regions ￼.
	•	Public Records API: REST API for county record data – parcels, ownership, sales history, assessments nationwide ￼. Access: Invite-only for commercial use; extensive historical property info.
	•	Performance (Reporting) API: Tracks listing impressions, views, and lead counts on Zillow/Trulia ￼. Access: Partners (brokers/MLS); used for analytics rather than end-user features.

Valuations – Zestimate API

A highlight of Zillow’s platform is the Zestimates API, which exposes Zillow’s proprietary home valuation estimates. This API lets developers retrieve the current estimated market value of homes (the “Zestimate”), as well as related valuations like the Rent Zestimate (estimated monthly rental value) and even foreclosure estimates, for ~100 million properties in the U.S. ￼. In a home search app, this could power features like showing an instant valuation for any address or listing. The Zestimate API is a RESTful service returning JSON data ￼ – typically you’d query by a property identifier (such as a Zillow Property ID or an address) and get back the latest valuation and maybe a confidence range.

This API covers both on-market and off-market properties, since Zillow’s database spans virtually all homes. It’s extremely useful for an interactive experience (e.g. “What’s this home worth?” tools on a map). However, access is restricted: Zillow positions this for commercial partners, requiring an application and agreement to their terms ￼. Usage likely requires obtaining API keys via the Bridge platform (with token auth) similar to the public data API ￼. Zillow explicitly differentiates that for non-commercial or research uses, one should use their downloadable data instead of the live API ￼. In practice, an approved API user may be limited in how they display or store Zestimate data (Zillow’s terms forbid storing data or using it without attribution).

Despite restrictions, the Zestimate API offers a rich capability: your PHP/MongoDB demo app could query a home’s Zillow valuation on the fly and display it alongside listings. This can enhance a Rocket Mortgage demo by showing how much a property is worth (and even its rental value), giving context for buyers and refinancers. It’s worth noting any usage must adhere to branding requirements (e.g. labeling estimates as “Zestimate®” and citing Zillow as the source) and call limits (historically around 1,000 calls per day by default) ￼.

Key capabilities of Zestimate API:
	•	Returns automated valuations for a given property – including home Zestimate (market value), Rent Zestimate (estimated rent), and foreclosure estimate if applicable ￼.
	•	Broad coverage (~100M properties). Enables features like showing values of homes not currently for sale, for comparison.
	•	Usage limits: Generally requires approval; default daily call limit ~1,000 for valuation data ￼, with higher allowances possible by arrangement.
	•	Terms: Data for display only (no resale or offline storage), with Zillow branding/disclaimer required ￼.

Mortgage & Financial APIs (Rates, Quotes, Calculators)

For the mortgage side of the demo, Zillow provides several APIs to integrate current financing information and tools:
	•	Get Current Rates API: This is a JSON API to retrieve the latest average mortgage interest rates from Zillow’s marketplace ￼. Zillow aggregates real-time quotes from lenders (via its mortgage marketplace called Custom Quotes), and this API exposes those average rates. By default it can return national average rates for common loan types (e.g. 30-year fixed, 15-year fixed, etc.), but it also allows you to customize queries with loan criteria ￼. For example, you can specify parameters such as purchase vs. refinance, loan program type (fixed 30-year, FHA, VA, etc.), loan amount or LTV buckets, credit score range, and even location (national vs. state or ZIP) to get a more tailored average rate ￼ ￼. The API can return historical rate trends as well if you specify a date range (e.g. last 30 days of rates) and even include the latest current rate value in the response ￼ ￼. This could power an interactive rate chart or a “today’s rates” feature in your app. The authentication is lightweight – no OAuth needed; you just include a Zillow-assigned partner ID in requests ￼. Zillow’s docs indicate no strict auth besides this partner token, but usage is subject to their terms of service (likely requiring that you’re a registered partner/developer). There may be rate limits on calls, though they are not explicitly stated on the overview (the assumption is that reasonable volumes are allowed for a partner ID, since this is often used openly on websites).
	•	Mortgage “Rate Table” API (Rate Cloud): For a more interactive mortgage shopping experience, Zillow (through its Mortech subsidiary) offers the RateCloud API ￼. This API lets you send in a borrower’s loan scenario – e.g. desired loan amount, credit score, down payment, etc. – and it will return actual rate quotes from multiple lenders in real time. Essentially, it powers the kind of rate tables you see on sites (including Zillow’s own) where lenders’ offers are listed and updated dynamically. Zillow notes that RateCloud can handle very high volume (millions of quote requests per hour) and underpins many major rate comparison tools ￼. However, this is a partner-level API: it requires a Mortech license/key and likely a commercial agreement ￼. It uses a server-to-server model (HTTP POST with loan criteria, returns JSON of pricing) and is not openly available to casual developers. If Rocket Mortgage wanted to demonstrate showing live competitor rates or a marketplace, integrating RateCloud would be the way – but it would require prior setup with Zillow/Mortech. For the demo, simply acknowledging that Zillow can supply real-time quote functionality via this API might suffice.
	•	Mortgage Calculators & Affordability: Zillow’s platform does not provide a single “affordability calculator API” or a direct “monthly payment calculator API” as a standalone service. Instead, developers would combine the rate data above with their own formulas or use Zillow’s mortgage rates and property info to compute payments. (For reference, Zillow’s affordability and mortgage calculators on their website are interactive tools but not exposed as JSON APIs.) That said, one could easily integrate Zillow’s current rate feed with a home price to calculate an estimated monthly payment. Zillow’s research site even publishes the formula for mortgage payments and affordability metrics ￼. So, while there isn’t a dedicated API endpoint that, say, takes income/debt and returns “how much house you can afford,” a demo app can leverage Zillow’s data (home value and interest rate) to showcase those calculations. In summary, affordability tools can be built on top of Zillow’s APIs – for example, using Zillow’s rate averages to make a “How much would my payment be?” feature for any listing, or using Zillow Home Value data to discuss equity and refinance options.
	•	Lender Lead/Quote Submission: In a scenario where the app might let users request personalized quotes or get pre-qualified, Zillow’s platform has APIs for integrating with their lender network. Specifically, the Lead Posting API (part of Mortech) allows an application to submit a borrower’s info as a lead to Zillow/Mortech ￼. This could trigger pricing and routing to lenders. There are also notification APIs (e.g. “Lender Contact Notification” or “Loan Request Notification” as referenced in Zillow’s partner docs) for when a user contacts a lender or requests a rate quote – these would send data back to the partner CRM. These are more behind-the-scenes integrations: for a demo, you might not actually post live leads, but it’s good to note that Rocket Mortgage could connect into Zillow’s system to catch leads or send loan offers. All these fall under partner integrations with authentication via API keys and often require a formal relationship (under Mortech’s terms).

Summary of Mortgage APIs:
	•	Current Average Rates API: Provides market average interest rates (national or by state), updated from live quotes ￼. Supports custom queries (loan type, credit, etc.) to feed rate displays or trend charts. Auth: simple partner ID, no OAuth ￼.
	•	Rate Quote (RateCloud) API: Returns detailed rate quotes from multiple lenders for a given borrower scenario ￼. Enables interactive rate comparison tables. Auth: Mortech license key (partner-only), high-volume capable.
	•	Mortgage Calculators: No direct API, but Zillow’s data (rates, home values) can drive payment or affordability calculations. Developers use Zillow’s rate feed plus formulas to create these features.
	•	Lead/Quote Submission APIs: Endpoints to send or receive mortgage leads (e.g. post a loan request to Zillow’s system, or get notified when a user contacts a lender). These use secure POST callbacks and are available to integrated lenders/partners ￼. Useful for tying the app into Rocket Mortgage’s CRM or Zillow’s loan marketplace.

Lender & Agent Information APIs

To complement home search and mortgage features, Zillow’s platform also exposes data about real estate professionals (agents and lenders):

Lender Reviews API: Zillow maintains a large database of consumer reviews for mortgage lenders and loan officers. The Zillow Lender Reviews API lets you retrieve the review summary and recent reviews for a specific lender/LO, identified by their NMLS ID ￼ ￼. For example, Rocket Mortgage (NMLS #3030) has a profile on Zillow with an overall star rating and user testimonials – this API can fetch those. It returns a JSON object containing the lender’s overall rating (average stars), total number of reviews, a list of the most recent review entries (up to 10), and links to the lender’s Zillow profile and to where a new review can be submitted ￼ ￼. By default it returns 3 reviews if no limit specified, but you can ask for up to 10 ￼. This is great for integrating social proof into the app – e.g. showing “Rocket Mortgage has 4.5★ (out of 5) from 500 reviews on Zillow” and perhaps displaying a few testimonials. The API is RESTful and requires a partner ID token (no user auth) similar to the rates API ￼. One important restriction is you must be an approved Zillow partner and use the data according to their terms (likely including not altering review content and providing proper attribution). But for a demo, one can definitely leverage this to enhance the mortgage section with real user feedback data.

Agent Reviews & Profile APIs: On the real estate agent side, Zillow allows access to agent ratings and reviews through the Agent Reviews API (sometimes just referred to as the Reviews API). This functions much like the lender reviews: an agent’s Zillow profile ID can be used to pull their client reviews, overall rating, etc. ￼ ￼. It’s primarily intended for brokerages or agents who want to showcase or manage their Zillow reviews on their own websites. A developer must register on the Bridge platform and request access to the “Zillow Agent Reviews” dataset ￼. Once granted, you get API keys to call the endpoint (which returns JSON). Capabilities include receiving notifications of new reviews, fetching all reviews in bulk, and even responding to reviews programmatically ￼. This suggests the API is read-write for review management (though responding likely requires authentication as the agent). For a Rocket Mortgage app, agent reviews might be less central, but if the demo includes finding a real estate agent or showcasing an agent’s info when viewing a listing, this API could supply the agent’s ratings. It’s worth noting that agent profile data (like their name, recent sales, etc.) might fall under a “Directory API” which Zillow mentions in its documentation ￼. Zillow’s Professional Directory API isn’t prominently advertised on the site, but it is referenced as a way to get information on real estate professionals (likely agent profiles in Zillow’s directory). This could allow an app to search for agents by locale or retrieve an agent’s profile details (office, photo, number of sales, etc.) to pair with review info. However, such an API would also be gated for approved use and subject to terms (including branding requirements – e.g. Zillow may require a “Provided by Zillow” label on any agent data from their directory ￼). In summary, agent data is accessible (especially reviews), but primarily oriented towards Zillow’s partner agents or brokers integrating their own info.

Key points on Lender/Agent APIs:
	•	Zillow Lender Reviews API: Provides recent reviews and ratings for a given lender/loan officer, looked up by NMLS ID ￼ ￼. Returns up to 10 latest reviews plus the overall star rating and profile links, in JSON format ￼. Usage: Requires partner registration (include partnerId in requests) ￼. Enables adding real user feedback to mortgage features.
	•	Agent Reviews API: Allows retrieval and management of agent reviews on Zillow ￼. Can pull an agent’s rating and all client reviews, and notify of new ones. Access: via Bridge platform, with API key and approval ￼. Useful if the app showcases realtors (e.g. a “Find an Agent” feature or showing the listing agent’s reputation).
	•	Agent/Pro Directory: Zillow’s terms mention a Directory API for professional info ￼ – likely to get agent or lender profile data (credentials, specialties, etc.). Not publicly documented on the site, but presumably available to partners. If needed, Rocket Mortgage’s app could integrate agent profiles (with permission) to enrich the home search experience (for instance, showing top local agents or linking to an agent’s Zillow profile).

Access Requirements & Usage Limitations

Using Zillow Group’s APIs for a third-party app comes with authentication and usage rules that developers must follow. Generally, each API requires an API key or partner ID obtained from Zillow by registering as a developer/partner. Some data (like the mortgage rates and lender reviews) simply use a partner token in the request ￼, whereas others (like MLS data, public records, and agent reviews via Bridge) use OAuth-like token exchange or API keys with secret keys ￼. In all cases, you must agree to Zillow’s API Terms of Use. These terms include important restrictions on usage:
	•	Daily Call Limits: Zillow imposes limits on how many API calls you can make per day. For example, the default limit is 1,000 calls per day for core property data (home valuation and property details APIs) ￼. If an app needs more, Zillow may grant higher limits case-by-case (often after reviewing the use case or requiring a partnership agreement). It’s crucial to design within these limits or request expansion for a production app.
	•	Non-Commercial vs. Commercial Use: Zillow’s APIs have historically been free for consumer-facing, non-commercial uses (or development/testing purposes), but using them in a commercial product or at high volume might require a commercial license. The terms actually allow Zillow API data to be used on a public-facing site/app for end-users’ personal use (even if you’re a business), but you cannot sell or repackage Zillow data itself. Some datasets (like Public Records and MLS feeds) are clearly for business partners and likely involve contracts or fees. Recent guides indicate Zillow offers paid plans for enhanced access (reports suggest paid tiers starting around $500/month for higher volume or additional features) ￼, whereas basic access with lower call volumes is free with registration ￼. Ensuring compliance with Zillow’s licensing is especially important for a Rocket Mortgage demo if it were to go beyond a prototype.
	•	Attribution and Display Requirements: Zillow requires that any data you pull is properly attributed. For instance, if you display a Zestimate, you must label it as “Zestimate®” and often include a Zillow logo or a footnote like “Source: Zillow” ￼. There are Branding and Display Guidelines that accompany the API terms ￼ ￼. Similarly, if you show reviews or ratings from Zillow, you may need to mention that they come from Zillow. The Agent Directory API in particular mandates a “Provided by Zillow” label above reviews data when displayed ￼. For the demo app, this means any integrated Zillow data (listings, values, or rates) should have a note or Zillow branding to be compliant.
	•	Real-Time Use & No Storage: Zillow’s terms prohibit permanently storing or caching their data. You’re expected to make live calls when you need the data and not build your own database of Zillow information ￼ ￼. After displaying it to the user, you shouldn’t retain it. This ensures users always see up-to-date info and prevents abuse (like aggregating Zillow data to compete with them). For example, you couldn’t scrape a whole region’s Zestimates and keep them locally; you’d call the Zestimate API for each property view on demand. In a MongoDB context, you’d likely only store references (like Zillow IDs) and fetch fresh data via API for each session/view.
	•	No Bulk or Derivative Use: The APIs are meant to fulfill specific user-driven requests (like “give me data for this address”), not bulk harvesting. Zillow disallows querying their API to dump large datasets or using data to train models etc., without permission ￼ ￼. Also, you can’t take elements of their data (e.g. a bunch of home addresses or latitude/longitude from their listings) and use it to enhance another database – that’s explicitly forbidden ￼. Each piece of Zillow data must stay tied to Zillow’s context (e.g. address with its Zestimate together).
	•	Authentication & Keys: For most APIs, after approval, you’ll receive a ZWSID or Partner ID (and possibly a secret). For legacy Zillow APIs, a “ZWSID” was used as a key in each request URL ￼. In the current platform, the partner ID (often looking like “X1-ZW…”) serves a similar role. Bridge APIs use OAuth 2.0 or token exchange: you log in to Bridge Interactive, get an access token and use it in request headers. Some partner APIs (like dotloop’s transaction API) use full OAuth 2.0 three-legged flows for user-specific data ￼. For the Rocket Mortgage demo, you’d likely handle authentication on the server side (for example, storing the Zillow API key and calling the services from PHP).
	•	Specific Partner Terms: Certain APIs especially in the Mortgage category (e.g. Mortech’s RateCloud, LOS integrations, lead posting) require signing a Master Service Agreement or partner contract ￼ ￼. They might also enforce data privacy (since you’d be sending personal info in lead posting) and security standards. These wouldn’t be obstacles for a demo if using mock data, but real integration would involve compliance (e.g. ensuring borrower info is transmitted securely and used properly).

In summary, Zillow’s developer APIs offer a wide range of data and functionality covering home search, property values, and mortgage tools. For a PHP/MongoDB demo app aimed at Rocket Mortgage, you could integrate: active listings search (via the MLS Listings API, if access is granted) to showcase home shopping; property details with Zestimates to show home value estimates; current mortgage rates and maybe a rate trend chart from the Get Current Rates API; an interactive mortgage calculator leveraging those rates (and even plugging in Zillow’s affordability logic); and lender info like Rocket Mortgage’s own Zillow reviews via the Lender Reviews API for credibility. All these APIs are publicly documented and available to developers who sign up, though many have usage limitations or require Zillow’s approval for high-volume and commercial deployments. By mixing and matching these APIs, one can create a rich, Zillow-powered real estate experience – just remember to follow the usage policies (partner registration, daily call limits, and proper attribution) when building out the demo ￼ ￼.
