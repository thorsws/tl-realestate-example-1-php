Here‚Äôs a clean, technical requirement document (with embedded prompt phrasing) you can give to Claude to generate the initial PHP + MongoDB real estate + mortgage demo app codebase.

üìù Project Requirements: Real Estate + Mortgage Demo App

üß© Overview

Build a functional real estate and mortgage demo application using PHP and MongoDB. This app simulates a homebuyer journey from browsing property listings to receiving mortgage pre-approval and submitting an offer. It should resemble a simplified Rocket Mortgage-style user flow, tailored for both real estate and lending stakeholders.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Language: PHP (latest version)
	‚Ä¢	Database: MongoDB
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Server-rendered HTML/CSS using PHP templates (no JS frameworks needed)
	‚Ä¢	External Data: Use a mock or real property listing API (see below)

‚∏ª

üë• Actors
	‚Ä¢	Buyer (User): Browses listings, saves favorites, submits mortgage info, sends offers.
	‚Ä¢	AI Assistant (Simulated): Not required for this version, but app should expose flows in a way that can be easily automated or driven later.
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Handles listings, saved state, mortgage logic, and document simulation.

üì¶ Features

1. Property Listings
	‚Ä¢	Pull property listings from a public API (e.g. Estated, Realtor.com) or simulate with local JSON files.
	‚Ä¢	Display key info: photo, address, price, beds, baths, description.
	‚Ä¢	Allow filter by city, price range, bedrooms.
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to ‚Äúsave‚Äù a listing (store in MongoDB by session/user).

2. Saved Listings
	‚Ä¢	List all saved properties for a given session/user.
	‚Ä¢	Allow removal.

3. Mortgage Pre-Approval
	‚Ä¢	Form to collect buyer inputs:
	‚Ä¢	Income
	‚Ä¢	Employment status
	‚Ä¢	Credit score (self-declared)
	‚Ä¢	Desired loan amount
	‚Ä¢	Simulate mortgage offer calculation:
	‚Ä¢	Choose from fixed rate types (e.g. 30yr fixed @ 6.25%)
	‚Ä¢	Store in MongoDB as preapproval_documents collection
	‚Ä¢	Display approval letter (HTML format, with downloadable PDF optional)

4. Make an Offer
	‚Ä¢	Select from saved listings.
	‚Ä¢	Fill out offer form:
	‚Ä¢	Offer price
	‚Ä¢	Contingencies
	‚Ä¢	Buyer info (name, email)
	‚Ä¢	Store in offers collection in MongoDB.
	‚Ä¢	Generate offer summary page.

‚∏ª

üóÇÔ∏è MongoDB Collections
	‚Ä¢	listings ‚Äì Preloaded or API-fetched homes
	‚Ä¢	saved_listings ‚Äì { user_id, listing_id }
	‚Ä¢	preapproval_documents ‚Äì { user_id, income, credit_score, rate, approved_amount }
	‚Ä¢	offers ‚Äì { user_id, listing_id, offer_price, contingencies, timestamp }

‚∏ª

üì° Listing API Options

Use one of:
	‚Ä¢	Estated (https://estated.com/)
	‚Ä¢	Realtor.com (if accessible)
	‚Ä¢	Local JSON mock (if no API access ‚Äî simulate 10‚Äì20 listings)

‚∏ª

üìê Structure and Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Keep code modular: separate routes/controllers/views.
	‚Ä¢	Organize by feature (e.g. /listings, /mortgage, /offers).
	‚Ä¢	Avoid frontend JS or frameworks ‚Äî this is a server-side rendered app.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Deliverables
	‚Ä¢	Fully working PHP app with:
	‚Ä¢	Listings page
	‚Ä¢	Save/list saved homes
	‚Ä¢	Pre-approval flow
	‚Ä¢	Offer flow
	‚Ä¢	All data stored in MongoDB
	‚Ä¢	README with setup instructions and sample listing data if mocking API
