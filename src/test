“Kasparov’s lesson was simple: human‑machine pairings outperform either alone. And in some cases, they go further, revealing new patterns, strategies, and forms of creativity that neither partner could reach alone. We see this dynamic with the ancient board game Go, where an AI dubbed AlphaGo displayed elegant, almost poetic play against grandmasters Lee Sedol and Ke Jie. The AI’s unexpected moves changed how these top players approached the game, redefining what was possible.”

Garry Kasparov has long advocated for human–machine collaboration, famously addressing this in his TED talk “Don’t Fear Intelligent Machines. Work With Them” (May 2017) — here he emphasizes that “Machines have calculations. We have understanding. Machines have objectivity. We have passion.”  ￼ ￼ Meanwhile, Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo vividly demonstrated this synergy through its iconic “Move 37” against Lee Sedol in March 2016 — a creative, unconventional move that “flummoxed even the world’s best Go players” and required Lee nearly fifteen minutes to respond  ￼. Follow‑up matches against Ke Jie in May 2017 further showcased AI’s ability to reshape human strategy at the highest levels  ￼. These episodes underscore how pairing human intuition with machine creativity can redefine mastery in ancient domains.
